Android Development Course by Dicoding with Kotlin Language

I joined Kotlin course and Android development (basic) Course in Dicoding supported by the Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy / Tourism Agency and Creative Republic of Indonesia in July - August 2020.

This repository contained of the assignment of my Android Development Course using Kotlin Language that I've learned from the Kotlin Language Course beforehand.

## Bar Volume
This is my very first Android program that I made using simple empty activity with TextView, EditText, and Button to calculate Cube's Volume.

## My Intent App
With this program, learned using intent to transfer data between Activity.

## My View and Views
In this program, I learned about how to build View in an Activity using RelativeLayout, LinearLayout, Tabel, etc.

## My RecyclerView
I learned how to build a Recycler view with this program. It's more applicable and mostly used than ListView.
